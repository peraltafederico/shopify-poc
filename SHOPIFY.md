2. **You're now in your Shopify Admin!** üéâ

## Step 2: Understanding Shopify Apps (Skip for Now)

For this basic setup, you don't need any additional apps. Later you might want:
- **Shopify Headless** (helps manage headless stores)
- **Metafields** (for custom product fields)

But let's skip this for now and focus on the essentials!

## Step 3: Create API Access for Next.js (Most Important Part!)

This is where we get the "key" that lets Next.js talk to Shopify.

### 3.1 Enable Custom App Development

1. **In your Shopify Admin**, look at the left sidebar

2. **Click "Settings"** (at the very bottom)

3. **In Settings, click "Apps and sales channels"**

4. **Click "Develop apps"** (might be at the top)

5. **First time?** You'll see "Enable custom app development"
   - Click "Enable custom app development"
   - Read the warning and click "Enable custom app development" again

### 3.2 Create Your App

1. **Click "Create an app"** button

2. **Fill in:**
   - App name: `Next.js Storefront`
   - App developer: Select your email
   - Click "Create app"

### 3.3 Configure What Your App Can Access

1. **Click "Configure Storefront API scopes"**

2. **Check these boxes** (scroll to find them):
   
   **Products (so Next.js can show products):**
   - ‚úÖ `Read product listings`
   - ‚úÖ `Read product inventory`
   - ‚úÖ `Read collection listings`
   
   **Cart & Checkout (so customers can buy):**
   - ‚úÖ `Read and modify checkouts`
   
   **Customers (for accounts):**
   - ‚úÖ `Read customer details`
   - ‚úÖ `Modify customer details`

3. **Click "Save"** at the top right

### 3.4 Configure Admin API (Quick Step)

1. **Click "Configure Admin API scopes"**

2. **Just check these basic ones:**
   - ‚úÖ `read_products`
   - ‚úÖ `read_product_listings`

3. **Click "Save"

### 3.5 Install Your App

1. **Click "Install app"** button (top right)

2. **Confirm by clicking "Install"** in the popup

### 3.6 Get Your Secret Access Token (VERY IMPORTANT!)

1. **Click "API credentials"** tab

2. **Scroll to "Storefront API access token"**

3. **Click "Reveal token once"**

4. **‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT: Copy this token NOW!**
   - It looks like: `shpat_1234567890abcdef`
   - Save it in a text file
   - You can't see it again after leaving this page!
   - This is what Next.js will use to get your store data

## Step 4: Add Some Test Products

Before connecting to Next.js, let's add some products to display!

### 4.1 Add Your First Product

1. **In the left sidebar, click "Products"**

2. **Click "Add product"**

3. **Fill in:**
   - Title: `Cool T-Shirt`
   - Description: `This is an awesome t-shirt!`
   
4. **Add a price:**
   - Scroll to "Pricing"
   - Price: `29.99`
   
5. **Add an image:**
   - In "Media" section, click "Add"
   - You can use free images from Unsplash (built-in!)
   - Or upload your own
   
6. **Set inventory:**
   - Scroll to "Inventory"
   - Check "Track quantity"
   - Available: `100`
   
7. **Make it active:**
   - On the right side, under "Status"
   - Select "Active"
   
8. **Click "Save"** (top right)

### 4.2 Add 2-3 More Products

Repeat the above steps to add a few more products. Ideas:
- "Awesome Hoodie" - $59.99
- "Classic Jeans" - $79.99
- "Summer Hat" - $19.99

## Step 5: Test If Everything Works

### 5.1 Find Your Store Information

1. **Your store domain:** Look at your browser URL
   - It's like: `nextjs-shopify-test.myshopify.com`
   - Write this down!

2. **Your access token:** The one you copied in Step 3.6
   - Like: `shpat_1234567890abcdef`

### 5.2 Quick Test (Optional)

If you want to test if your API works, you can:

1. **Open a new browser tab**

2. **Go to:** `https://your-store-name.myshopify.com/api/2024-01/graphql`
   - Replace `your-store-name` with your actual store name

3. **If you see any response**, your store is ready!

## Step 6: Create a Collection (Optional but Recommended)

Collections group products together (like "Summer Sale" or "T-Shirts").

### 6.1 Create Your First Collection

1. **Click "Products"** in sidebar

2. **Click "Collections"**

3. **Click "Create collection"**

4. **Fill in:**
   - Title: `All Products`
   - Description: `Browse all our products`
   
5. **Collection type:**
   - Select "Automated"
   - Conditions: "Product price is greater than $0"
   - This automatically includes all products!
   
6. **Click "Save"**

## Step 7: Quick Settings Check

### 7.1 Enable Customer Accounts

1. **Go to Settings** ‚Üí **Checkout**

2. **Scroll to "Customer accounts"**

3. **Select:** "Accounts are optional"
   - This lets customers checkout as guests
   - Easier for testing!

4. **Click "Save"

## Step 8: Skip Complex Setup (Use Defaults)

For development, Shopify's default settings work perfectly:

‚úÖ **Checkout:** Already configured  
‚úÖ **Payments:** Test mode is automatic in dev stores  
‚úÖ **Shipping:** Default rates are fine for testing  

**Note:** In development stores, you can place test orders without real payment!

## Step 9: Your Store URLs

### For Development (What We're Using)
‚úÖ Your store URL: `https://your-store-name.myshopify.com`  
‚úÖ Admin URL: `https://your-store-name.myshopify.com/admin`

### For Real Business (Future)
- You can add custom domains like `www.mycoolstore.com`
- This costs extra (domain registration)
- Not needed for development!

## Step 10: Collect Your Information for Next.js

### Write Down These Two Things:

1. **Your Store Domain:**
   - Look at your browser URL
   - Example: `nextjs-shopify-test.myshopify.com`
   - Write: `SHOPIFY_STORE_DOMAIN=nextjs-shopify-test.myshopify.com`

2. **Your Access Token:**
   - The long code from Step 3.6
   - Example: `shpat_1234567890abcdef`
   - Write: `SHOPIFY_STOREFRONT_ACCESS_TOKEN=shpat_1234567890abcdef`

**Save these in a text file called `shopify-info.txt` - you'll need them in the next guide!**
