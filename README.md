# Shopify + Next.js Integration POC

## Overview

This proof of concept explores different approaches to integrate Next.js with Shopify, ultimately demonstrating why a headless commerce approach using Shopify's Storefront API is the best solution.

## The Journey

### 1. Understanding Shopify Liquid

We started by investigating Shopify's native templating language, Liquid:
- **What is Liquid?** A server-side templating language that runs on Shopify's servers
- **How it works:** Shopify injects variables (customer, cart, products) during server-side rendering
- **The limitation:** Liquid variables only exist during Shopify's render process

See [LIQUID.md](./LIQUID.md) for a detailed explanation of why Liquid can't interact with external applications like Next.js.

### 2. The Challenge

The fundamental challenge we discovered:
- **Liquid runs on Shopify's servers** (Ruby-based)
- **Next.js runs on different servers** (Node.js-based)
- **No direct variable sharing** between different server processes
- **Different execution times** - Liquid finishes before Next.js even starts

### 3. Why Next.js?

We chose Next.js for the frontend because:
- **Modern Development:** React-based with latest web standards
- **Performance:** Server-side rendering and static generation
- **Developer Experience:** Hot reload, TypeScript, modern tooling
- **Flexibility:** Complete control over UI/UX
- **Scalability:** Can handle high traffic independently of Shopify

### 4. The Solution: Headless Commerce

After exploring various approaches, we implemented a headless commerce architecture:

```
Shopify Backend          API            Next.js Frontend
(Commerce Engine)   <---------->       (Custom Experience)
- Products                             - Modern UI
- Inventory          GraphQL           - Fast Performance  
- Checkout                             - Full Control
- Orders                               - Custom Features
```

```

## Key Learnings

1. **Liquid is isolated:** Runs only on Shopify's servers, can't share variables with external apps
2. **APIs are the bridge:** Storefront API provides the data bridge between Shopify and Next.js
3. **Headless is powerful:** Separating backend (Shopify) from frontend (Next.js) offers flexibility
4. **Simple setup:** Despite the complex concepts, implementation is straightforward

## The Implementation

Our proof of concept demonstrates:
- ✅ Fetching products from Shopify using GraphQL
- ✅ Displaying products in a modern Next.js app
- ✅ Server-side rendering for SEO
- ✅ TypeScript for type safety
- ✅ Responsive design with Tailwind CSS

## Why This Approach?

### Traditional Shopify (Liquid)
- ❌ Limited by Shopify's theming system
- ❌ Harder to implement modern features
- ❌ Less control over performance
- ❌ Restricted development workflow

### Headless with Next.js
- ✅ Complete control over frontend
- ✅ Modern development experience
- ✅ Better performance potential
- ✅ Easier to scale and maintain
- ✅ Can integrate with other services

## Getting Started

1. **Read the guides:**
   - [LIQUID.md](./LIQUID.md) - Understand why we can't use Liquid
   - [SHOPIFY.md](./SHOPIFY.md) - Set up your Shopify store
   - [PLAN.md](./PLAN.md) - See what we built

2. **Run the project:**
   ```bash
   cd shopify-nextjs-store
   npm install
   npm run dev
   ```

## Conclusion

This POC proves that while Shopify Liquid and Next.js can't directly communicate due to fundamental architectural differences, the Storefront API provides an excellent bridge for building modern, performant e-commerce experiences. The headless approach gives developers the best of both worlds: Shopify's robust commerce backend with the flexibility of modern frontend frameworks.
